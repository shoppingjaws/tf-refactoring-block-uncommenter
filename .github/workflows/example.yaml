          pr-body: |
            This PR automatically comments out executed Terraform refactoring blocks (moved/import/removed).

            These blocks have been executed and should be commented out to:
            - Prevent re-execution of the same refactoring
            - Keep execution history for reference
            - Maintain clean Terraform state management
